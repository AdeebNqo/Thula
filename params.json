{"name":"Thula","tagline":"This is Thula. A clone of QKSMS. QKSMS is an open source replacement to the stock messaging app on Android. It is currently available on the Google Play Store","body":"### Reclaiming SMS.\r\nThula is an SMS application. It is built for a South African audience.It is inspired and cloned from QKSMS. QKSMS is dubbed as an application which \"[...] brings a refreshingly beautiful and responsive Material Design touch to the stale state of text messaging. In a world with clunky SMS and MMS apps cluttered with bloat and ads, QKSMS is something to get excited about. We’re making texting magical again.\" Thula gives you the same features with more. Thula's main feature which sets it apart from QKSMS is it's spam filtering/anti-annoyancecapability.\r\nSouth Africans recieve annoying spam SMSes ranging from competitions, life insurance to other unsolicited offers. A website which is said to help in preventing this is the [National Opt Out website](https://www.nationaloptout.co.za/).\r\n\r\nThe National Opt Out website makes the following claim:\r\n\r\n> \"[...] helps you to make sure your address, email address, telephone and cell number are no longer available to  organisations, who are members of the DMA, who want to make offers and send information that you do not wish to receive. You can also do this by contacting companies directly and asking them not to contact you.\"\r\n\r\nThe major issue, if it's not obvious, is that it does not cater for companies which are not part of the Direct Marketing Association of Southern Africa.\r\nThis is major loophole. Thula addresses this by giving you the control over your SMSes. It also allows you to effectively \"mute\" SMSes frompossible stalkers.\r\n\r\nEssentially, I created this application to remove the dependence on a third party. I was not comfortable giving a website which is owned by a company with the generic name Computer Facilities (Pty) Ltd (According to their SSL certificate) sensitive information about me such my ID Number. Thula is my contribution to people who may share my feelings.\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\nThe application icon is derived from the work of Michal Beno (Speech Bubble by Michal Beno from the Noun Project). Thula is cloned from QKSMS, which is created by QK Labs. QK Labs, at the time of writing, is lead by Moez Bhatti. Thanks to Moez and the guys who worked on QKSMS.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThula is currently maintaned independently of QKSMS by Zola Mahlaza (@adeebnqo). If you want to contribute, I strongly advise that you consider contributing to QKSMS instead. However, if you feel like you're more interested in Thula, feel free to create a pull request.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Thula?
